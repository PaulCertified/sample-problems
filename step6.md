# Step 6: Examine Source Code (if available)

## Source Code Availability
After thoroughly searching the repository, I confirmed that **no source code files are available** for examination. The search included:

- Looking for common programming language file extensions (.go, .c, .cpp, .h, .py, .js, .java, etc.)
- Checking for hidden configuration files
- Examining the entire repository structure

This is consistent with our initial findings in Step 1, where we noted that the repository only contains:
- Binary executables for both programs (Windows, Mac, and Linux versions)
- A Dockerfile for containerized execution
- A README.md with instructions

## Inferred Application Architecture

Although we don't have access to the source code, we can infer certain aspects of the applications' architecture and design based on the logged behavior:

### Common Components (Both Programs)
1. **Credentials Database**: Both applications load 752 entries from what appears to be a local credentials store
2. **Authentication System**: Both have an authentication thread that starts during initialization
3. **Network Listeners**: Both attempt to bind to ports 6000 and 6001
4. **Logging System**: Both use structured logging with different levels (info, trace, fatal)

### Program 1 Specific
1. **Port Binding Requirement**: Requires exclusive access to port 6000
2. **Error Handling**: Terminates immediately when port binding fails without additional recovery attempts

### Program 2 Specific
1. **Multi-tier Database Architecture**:
   - Successfully connects to a "config server" ('config.local')
   - Attempts to connect to a PostgreSQL database ('main.local' on port 5432)
2. **Configuration Reading**: Reads 4 configuration entries from the config server
3. **Connection Retry Logic**: Makes three attempts to connect to the database before failing

## Inferred Configuration Requirements

Based on log analysis, the applications likely require:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `PROGRAM_DEBUG`: Controls verbose logging (we've used this)
   - Potentially other undocumented environment variables for configuration

2. **Network Requirements**:
   - Ports 6000 and 6001 must be available for binding
   - For program2, PostgreSQL database access on port 5432

3. **External Services**:
   - program1: No external dependencies identified beyond port availability
   - program2: Requires running PostgreSQL database service at 'main.local:5432'

## Conclusion

Without source code, we're limited to black-box analysis based on application behavior. However, the debug logs have provided sufficient information to identify the root causes of the initialization failures:

1. **Program 1**: Fails due to port 6000 being unavailable
2. **Program 2**: Fails due to inability to connect to the PostgreSQL database

These findings align with the README's statement that the programs are designed to always error and cannot be fixed as part of this exercise.
