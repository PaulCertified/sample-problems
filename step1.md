# Step 1: Environment Setup and Initial Inspection

## Repository Structure
After examining the repository, I found the following files and directories:

- **Dockerfile**: Used to create the Docker container for running the applications
- **README.md**: Contains instructions for running the programs and enabling debug mode
- **binaries/**: Directory containing executable files
  - program1.exe (Windows)
  - program1_darwin_amd64 (Mac)
  - program1_linux_amd64 (Linux)
  - program2.exe (Windows)
  - program2_darwin_amd64 (Mac)
  - program2_linux_amd64 (Linux)
- **plan.md**: Our step-by-step plan for diagnosing the issues

## Dockerfile Analysis
The Dockerfile uses Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) as the base image and:
- Copies the Linux versions of program1 and program2 to /usr/local/bin/
- Sets the default command to run program1
- Very simple setup with minimal dependencies or configuration

```
FROM ubuntu:focal

COPY binaries/program1_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/program1
COPY binaries/program2_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/program2

CMD ["program1"]
```

## Documentation Review
The README.md file provides:
- Confirmation that both sample programs exit with errors during startup
- Instructions for running the programs using Docker or directly using binaries
- Information on enabling debug logging via the PROGRAM_DEBUG=true environment variable
- Methods to supply this environment variable in Docker, Mac, and Windows environments
- Important notes that:
  - The applications don't actually do real actions (simulated for learning)
  - The programs are designed to always error and cannot be fixed
  - The goal is only to diagnose the problems, not to fix them

## Initial Observations
- There are no source code files available in the repository, only compiled binaries
- The Dockerfile is very minimal with no additional dependencies or configurations
- No configuration files are present that might provide clues about requirements
- Both programs have versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Debug mode is available using an environment variable, which will be crucial for diagnosis

## Next Steps
Based on this initial inspection, our next steps will be to:
1. Run each program without debug mode to observe the default error behavior
2. Run each program with debug mode enabled to gather more detailed information
3. Analyze the errors and logs to determine the root causes
