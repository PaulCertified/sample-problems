# Step 4: Run Program 2 Without Debug Mode

## Running Program 2
I ran program2 without any debug flags using:
```bash
docker run sample-problems program2
```

## Observed Error Behavior

### Output

### Exit Code
The program exited with exit code 1, indicating an error condition.

## Initial Observations and Hypotheses

Based on the default error behavior, I can make the following observations and hypotheses about program2:

1. **Application Initialization Process**: Program2 appears to have a similar but extended initialization sequence compared to program1:
   - Initial startup
   - Loading credentials from a database
   - Starting an authentication thread
   - Starting listeners on ports 6000 and 6001
   - Successfully binding to both ports
   - Discovering a database named 'main.local'
   - Attempting to connect to this database

2. **Failure Point**: Unlike program1, program2 gets further in the initialization sequence. It successfully starts listeners on both ports but fails after attempting to connect to the database 'main.local'.

3. **Differences from Program1**:
   - Program2 doesn't have the port 6000 conflict that program1 experienced
   - Program2 progresses further in the initialization sequence
   - Program2 appears to fail during database connection rather than port binding

4. **Initial Hypotheses/Possible Causes**:
   - **Database Connection Issues**: The application finds the database 'main.local' but may fail to establish a connection
   - **Database Credentials**: There might be authentication problems when connecting to the database
   - **Missing Database Dependencies**: Required database drivers or libraries might be missing
   - **Network Configuration**: The database might be unreachable due to network configuration
   - **Database Schema**: The database might exist but lack required tables or schemas

5. **Timing Information**: Similar to program1, there are noticeable delays between steps:
   - ~2 seconds between loading credentials and starting the authentication thread
   - ~1 second between starting the thread and the listeners
   - ~1 second in binding to both ports
   - ~1 second to discover the database
   - ~3 seconds between attempting to connect and the fatal error

6. **Limited Error Details**: As with program1, the default error output doesn't provide specific information about why the database connection failed. Running with debug mode enabled will likely provide more details.

## Next Steps

To further diagnose the issue with program2, we will:
1. Run program2 with debug mode enabled to get more detailed logging information about the database connection failure
2. Look for specific errors or warnings related to database connectivity
3. Determine if the problem is related to missing database drivers, authentication issues, or network configuration
