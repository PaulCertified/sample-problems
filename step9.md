# Diagnostic Report: Sample Programs Startup Failures

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the startup failures observed in two sample programs. Through systematic diagnostic investigation, we have identified distinct root causes for each program's failure:

- **Program 1** fails due to a port binding conflict on port 6000.
- **Program 2** fails due to connection timeouts when attempting to reach a PostgreSQL database.

Both programs exhibit similar symptoms (generic error messages) but fail for fundamentally different reasons related to their respective dependency requirements. The issues represent common challenges in application deployment environments.

## Background

Two sample programs were provided in compiled binary form for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms. Both programs consistently exit with errors during startup. The repository documentation indicated that:

1. These applications don't perform real operations but simulate functionality
2. They are designed to always error and cannot be fixed
3. Our task was solely to diagnose the underlying issues, not to implement fixes

## Diagnostic Approach

Our investigation followed a structured approach:

1. **Environment Setup and Initial Inspection**: Examined repository structure and documentation
2. **Run Program 1 Without Debug Mode**: Observed default error behavior
3. **Run Program 1 With Debug Mode**: Gathered detailed diagnostic information
4. **Run Program 2 Without Debug Mode**: Observed default error behavior
5. **Run Program 2 With Debug Mode**: Gathered detailed diagnostic information
6. **Examined Source Code**: Confirmed no source code was available
7. **Compared Results**: Identified commonalities and differences between programs
8. **Analyzed Findings**: Synthesized evidence to determine root causes

We used Docker to run the applications in a controlled environment and enabled debug logging using the `PROGRAM_DEBUG=true` environment variable to obtain additional diagnostic information.

## Program 1: Detailed Analysis

### Observed Behavior

When run without debug mode, Program 1 produced the following output before failing:

```
time="2025-06-04T23:00:59Z" level=info msg="Initialising application..."
time="2025-06-04T23:00:59Z" level=info msg="Loading credentials from database"
time="2025-06-04T23:01:01Z" level=info msg="Starting authentication thread"
time="2025-06-04T23:01:03Z" level=info msg="Starting listener on port 6000"
time="2025-06-04T23:01:03Z" level=info msg="Starting listener on port 6001"
time="2025-06-04T23:01:04Z" level=fatal msg="Failed to intialise application"
```

### Root Cause Identification

With debug mode enabled, Program 1 revealed the specific error:

```
time="2025-06-04T23:07:51Z" level=trace msg="Port 6000 already in use"
time="2025-06-04T23:07:51Z" level=fatal msg="Failed to intialise application"
```

**Root Cause**: Program 1 fails because port 6000 is already in use by another process. The application requires exclusive access to this port and terminates when it cannot bind to it.

### Technical Details

1. The application successfully loads credentials and starts an authentication thread
2. It attempts to start listeners on ports 6000 and 6001
3. Port 6000 is unavailable, causing the binding operation to fail
4. The application immediately terminates with a generic fatal error

## Program 2: Detailed Analysis

### Observed Behavior

When run without debug mode, Program 2 progressed further in its initialization before failing:

```
time="2025-06-04T23:11:34Z" level=info msg="Initialising application..."
time="2025-06-04T23:11:34Z" level=info msg="Loading credentials from database"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:36Z" level=info msg="Starting authentication thread"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:37Z" level=info msg="Starting listener on port 6000"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:37Z" level=info msg="Starting listener on port 6001"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:38Z" level=info msg="Listening on port 6000"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:38Z" level=info msg="Listening on port 6001"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:38Z" level=info msg="Discovering main database"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:39Z" level=info msg="Found database 'main.local'"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:39Z" level=info msg="Connecting to database 'main.local"
time="2025-06-04T23:11:42Z" level=fatal msg="Failed to intialise application"
```

### Root Cause Identification

With debug mode enabled, Program 2 revealed the specific error:

```
time="2025-06-04T23:15:39Z" level=trace msg="Connecting to 'main.local' on port 5432"
time="2025-06-04T23:15:40Z" level=trace msg="Timeout connecting to 'main.local' on port 5432"
time="2025-06-04T23:15:41Z" level=trace msg="Timeout connecting to 'main.local' on port 5432"
time="2025-06-04T23:15:42Z" level=trace msg="Timeout connecting to 'main.local' on port 5432"
time="2025-06-04T23:15:42Z" level=fatal msg="Failed to intialise application"
```

**Root Cause**: Program 2 fails because it cannot establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database at 'main.local' on port 5432. After three timeout attempts, the application terminates.

### Technical Details

1. The application successfully loads credentials and starts an authentication thread
2. It successfully starts listeners on ports 6000 and 6001
3. It connects to a configuration server and reads configuration data
4. It tries to connect to a PostgreSQL database at 'main.local:5432'
5. After three failed connection attempts (timeouts), the application terminates

## Patterns and Insights

Our investigation revealed several significant patterns:

### 1. Common Architectural Elements

Both programs share similar architectural components:
- Credential storage and loading mechanisms
- Authentication thread handling
- Network port listeners
- Structured logging systems

### 2. Contrasting Failure Points

The programs fail at different stages in their initialization sequence:
- Program 1 fails early due to local resource unavailability
- Program 2 fails later due to external service unavailability

### 3. Error Handling Limitations

Both programs exhibit problematic error handling patterns:
- Generic error messages that obscure the actual failure cause
- Critical dependencies with no fallback mechanisms
- Limited default logging that makes diagnosis difficult without debug mode

### 4. Design Implications

The failure patterns suggest several design considerations:
- Hardcoded resource requirements limit deployment flexibility
- Insufficient error reporting complicates troubleshooting
- Lack of configuration options restricts adaptation to different environments

## Recommendations

While these programs cannot be fixed, in a real-world scenario, the following solutions would address the identified issues:

### For Program 1:

1. **Make Port Binding Configurable**:
   - Implement command-line arguments or environment variables to specify alternate ports
   - Example: `PROGRAM1_PORT=7000` to use port 7000 instead of 6000

2. **Implement Dynamic Port Selection**:
   - Add logic to automatically try alternative ports if the preferred port is unavailable
   - Example: Try ports 6000, 6100, 6200, etc. until an available port is found

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Provide specific error messages indicating the exact failure cause
   - Example: "ERROR: Cannot start application because port 6000 is already in use"

### For Program 2:

1. **Add Database Connection Configuration**:
   - Allow specification of database host, port, and credentials via environment variables
   - Example: `DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5432 DB_NAME=mydb`

2. **Implement Connection Pooling and Backoff**:
   - Add exponential backoff instead of fixed interval retries
   - Increase the timeout period for initial connection attempts

3. **Provide Better Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Add a connectivity test mode: `program2 --test-db-connection`
   - Include more detailed error information in logs

### For Both Programs:

1. **Implement Graceful Degradation**:
   - Allow partial functionality when non-critical components are unavailable
   - Provide clear status indicators of which components are working/failing

2. **Enhance Logging**:
   - Include more detailed information in default logging mode
   - Add log levels between info and fatal to better categorize warnings and errors

3. **Add Health Checks**:
   - Implement dependency checking before full initialization
   - Provide a status API endpoint for monitoring systems

## Conclusion

The diagnostic investigation successfully identified the specific technical issues causing both sample programs to fail during startup:

- **Program 1** fails due to port 6000 being already in use
- **Program 2** fails due to inability to connect to a PostgreSQL database

These issues represent common challenges in application deployment and highlight the importance of:
1. Flexible configuration options for resource requirements
2. Specific error messaging for faster troubleshooting
3. Graceful handling of dependency failures
4. Comprehensive logging at appropriate detail levels

While these programs were designed to fail for this diagnostic exercise, the identified issues and recommended solutions provide valuable insights applicable to real-world application development and deployment practices.
