# Plan of Action for Diagnosing Sample Problems

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps we'll take to diagnose why two sample programs are exiting with errors during startup. Our goal is to identify the root causes and document our findings in detail.

## Step 1: Environment Setup and Initial Inspection
- Examine the repository structure to understand what files are available
- Review the Dockerfile to understand the environment and dependencies
- Check if there are any README files or documentation that might provide clues

## Step 2: Run Program 1 Without Debug Mode
- Run program1 using Docker to observe the default error behavior
- Note the exact error messages, exit codes, and any other relevant output
- Form initial hypotheses about potential issues

## Step 3: Run Program 1 With Debug Mode
- Run program1 with PROGRAM_DEBUG=true to get additional logging information
- Analyze the verbose output to look for clues about what's causing the error
- Look for patterns in the logs such as missing dependencies, configuration issues, etc.
- Refine our hypotheses based on the debug information

## Step 4: Run Program 2 Without Debug Mode
- Run program2 using Docker to observe the default error behavior
- Note the exact error messages, exit codes, and any other relevant output
- Form initial hypotheses about potential issues

## Step 5: Run Program 2 With Debug Mode
- Run program2 with PROGRAM_DEBUG=true to get additional logging information
- Analyze the verbose output to look for clues about what's causing the error
- Look for patterns in the logs such as missing dependencies, configuration issues, etc.
- Refine our hypotheses based on the debug information

## Step 6: Examine Source Code (if available)
- Look for any source code files that might be available in the repository
- Review the code to understand the application's functionality and potential failure points
- Look for hardcoded configuration, environment variable requirements, etc.

## Step 7: Compare Results
- Compare the errors and debug logs from both programs to identify commonalities or differences
- Determine if both programs are failing for the same reason or for different reasons

## Step 8: Analysis and Documentation
- Synthesize all findings from the previous steps
- Create a detailed summary of what's causing each program to fail
- Document the evidence supporting our conclusions
- Include specific details from logs and error messages in our analysis

## Step 9: Prepare Final Report
- Write a comprehensive report documenting:
  - The errors observed
  - The diagnostic steps taken
  - The root causes identified
  - Any patterns or insights discovered during the investigation
  - Recommendations for what would fix the issues (even though we won't implement them)

## Note
As per the instructions, we understand that:
- These applications are simulated and don't actually perform real operations
- The programs are designed to always error and cannot be fixed
- Our task is solely to diagnose the problems, not to fix them
