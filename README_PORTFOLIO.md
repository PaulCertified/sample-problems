# Sample Problem Diagnostic Exercise

## Paul Gipson - Technical Diagnostic Analysis

### Overview

This repository contains my comprehensive technical diagnostic analysis of two sample applications designed to simulate common startup failures. It demonstrates my systematic troubleshooting methodology, attention to detail, and ability to infer architectural patterns from limited information.

### Project Background

I was presented with a technical challenge: diagnose why two compiled applications consistently fail on startup without having access to the source code. This simulates a common scenario in production environments where applications fail and engineers must determine the root cause through logs, error messages, and environmental analysis.

### Diagnostic Approach

My approach to diagnosing complex technical issues follows a systematic methodology:

1. **Structured Analysis**: I developed a step-by-step diagnostic plan to methodically isolate the variables and potential failure points.

2. **Iterative Testing**: I ran each application both with and without debug mode to compare behavior and gather more detailed diagnostic information.

3. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Each conclusion is supported by specific log entries and error messages, with clear linkage between observations and root causes.

4. **Architectural Inference**: By analyzing application behavior, I reconstructed the likely architecture and dependencies without access to source code.

### Key Findings

My investigation determined that:

- **Program 1** fails due to a port binding conflict on port 6000, demonstrating issues with hardcoded resource requirements and inflexible configuration.

- **Program 2** fails due to PostgreSQL database connection timeouts, illustrating challenges in distributed system dependencies and connection management.

Both programs exhibited similar limitations in error reporting and graceful degradation, but failed for fundamentally different reasons at different points in their startup sequence.

### Technical Documents

This repository includes:

- **Final Report**: A professional-grade analysis suitable for technical stakeholders ([finalreport.md](finalreport.md))
- **Diagnostic Plan**: My original structured approach to problem solving ([plan.md](plan.md))
- **Detailed Steps**: Documentation of each investigative step ([step1.md](step1.md) through [step9.md](step9.md))

### Skills Demonstrated

This exercise showcases my technical capabilities in:

- **Methodical Troubleshooting**: Following a systematic process to isolate and identify issues
- **Technical Documentation**: Creating clear, well-organized documentation of findings
- **System Architecture**: Inferring system design and dependencies from behavioral analysis
- **Docker Container Usage**: Utilizing containerization for controlled testing environments
- **Log Analysis**: Extracting meaningful insights from application logs and error messages
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Distinguishing symptoms from underlying issues

### Professional Application

The diagnostic patterns demonstrated here apply directly to real-world scenarios including:

- Troubleshooting microservice startup failures
- Diagnosing resource conflicts in container deployments
- Identifying network connectivity issues in distributed systems
- Analyzing dependency failures in complex application stacks
